# ProtoSchool Nairobi

Welcome to the Nairobi chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

We are a group of people passionate about the decentralized web and excited to learn, teach, and share ideas. Everyone is welcome!

## Organizers

For this chapter, we are working with [Scend Distributed]() to provide a platform for the development of tech skills through courses, bootcamps & trainings. We currently offer developers opportunities to learn various decentralized web technologies including IPFS/IPLD & libPp2p. We also cover various layer two solutions and Protocol-extensible developer APIs & languages e.g. Web3.js, ether.js, Solidity, Rust. Scend Distributed champions the ability to easily and efficiently transfer value without centralized institutions acting as clearing agents which is at the heart of P2P & Web 3.0 technology.

Working with [Scend Distributed](), we have launched a self-paced online learning platform [Porium]() which hosts several beginner-to-advanced courses available for free.
